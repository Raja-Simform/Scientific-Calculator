# Scientific Calculator

This is a web-based Scientific Calculator built using vanilla JavaScript. It supports basic arithmatic operations, advanced mathematical functions, trigonometry operations and parantheses for complex calculations.

## Tasks:
### 1. Build a Scientific Calculator
- Create a responsive HTML UI that includes buttons for all basic arithmetic operations and scientific functions like:
- Basic: `+, -, *, /, %, =`
- Advanced: `sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, `tan(x)`, `log(x)`, `sqrt(x)`, `x^y`, `Ï€`, `e`, etc.

### 2. Implement Functionality in JavaScript
- `Closures`: Use closures for encapsulating private variables and methods for calculation history.
- `Prototype`: Implement basic operations using prototype methods.
- `Classes`: Create a Calculator class to encapsulate all scientific and basic operations.
- `this` Keyword: Demonstrate correct usage of this in event handlers and class methods.
- `Modularity`: Split your code into multiple modules (e.g., one for utility functions, another for the main logic).
- `Error Handling`: Ensure proper handling of invalid inputs or calculations (e.g., division by zero, invalid operations).

### 3. Optional Add-ons (Bonus)
- Add a history feature that allows users to view their recent calculations.
- Support keyboard input for calculator operations.
- Implement themes (e.g., light/dark mode) using CSS and JS.
- Use localStorage/sessionStorage to persist the calculation history.# Scientific-Calculator
